The available information is described below:

- **data**: Data directory. 
- **figures**: Figures generated using the notebooks.
- **moisture**: scripts required to download and analyse the ERA5 data according to the basin geographic information.
- **figures-timeseries**: This notebook contains the main code to analyse the data in the paper and generate most of the figures.
- **figures-grace.ipynb**: This notebook is used only to compare the data of the basin using the LAR analysis and the analogous data products from GRACE.
